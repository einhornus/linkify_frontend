I paint my lips with blacking I adore the colour black
And my hero he is all woven
Out of delicate candy scents
As I powder my nostrils with cocaine I come out on to the promenade
And the stars shine for me beautifully
And hell seems appealing
<br>
Let's meet up tonight
We will smoke some opium
Let's meet up tonight
We will speak Chinese
Don't hide the music it is opium
For no one but us
Let's die happily tonight
We will play decadence
<br>
Kill me kill yourself you won't change anything
This story has no end you won't change anything
Paint your eyelashes with lipstick
And your lips with hairspray
You'll be a dead princess
And I your loyal dog
<br
Let's meet up tonight
We will smoke some opium
Let's meet up tonight
We will speak Chinese
Don't hide the music it is opium
For no one but us
Let's die happily tonight
We will play decadence
<br>
Let's meet up tonight
Let's meet up tonight
Don't hide the music it is opium
For no one but us
Let's die happily tonight
