<h4>Philemon: 1.1</h4><br>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.2</h4><br>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.3</h4><br>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.4</h4><br>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.5</h4><br>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.6</h4><br>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.7</h4><br>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.8</h4><br>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.9</h4><br>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.10</h4><br>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.11</h4><br>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.12</h4><br>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.13</h4><br>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.14</h4><br>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.15</h4><br>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.16</h4><br>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.17</h4><br>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.18</h4><br>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.19</h4><br>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.20</h4><br>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.21</h4><br>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.22</h4><br>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.23</h4><br>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.24</h4><br>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
***
<h4>Philemon: 1.25</h4><br>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
***
