<h4>Titus: 1.1</h4><br>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
***
<h4>Titus: 1.2</h4><br>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
***
<h4>Titus: 1.3</h4><br>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
***
<h4>Titus: 1.4</h4><br>To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
***
<h4>Titus: 1.5</h4><br>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
***
<h4>Titus: 1.6</h4><br>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
***
<h4>Titus: 1.7</h4><br>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
***
<h4>Titus: 1.8</h4><br>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
***
<h4>Titus: 1.9</h4><br>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
***
<h4>Titus: 1.10</h4><br>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
***
<h4>Titus: 1.11</h4><br>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
***
<h4>Titus: 1.12</h4><br>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
***
<h4>Titus: 1.13</h4><br>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
***
<h4>Titus: 1.14</h4><br>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
***
<h4>Titus: 1.15</h4><br>Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
***
<h4>Titus: 1.16</h4><br>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
***
<h4>Titus: 2.1</h4><br>But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
***
<h4>Titus: 2.2</h4><br>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
***
<h4>Titus: 2.3</h4><br>The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
***
<h4>Titus: 2.4</h4><br>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
***
<h4>Titus: 2.5</h4><br>To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
***
<h4>Titus: 2.6</h4><br>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
***
<h4>Titus: 2.7</h4><br>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
***
<h4>Titus: 2.8</h4><br>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
***
<h4>Titus: 2.9</h4><br>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;
***
<h4>Titus: 2.10</h4><br>Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
***
<h4>Titus: 2.11</h4><br>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
***
<h4>Titus: 2.12</h4><br>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
***
<h4>Titus: 2.13</h4><br>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
***
<h4>Titus: 2.14</h4><br>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
***
<h4>Titus: 2.15</h4><br>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
***
<h4>Titus: 3.1</h4><br>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
***
<h4>Titus: 3.2</h4><br>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
***
<h4>Titus: 3.3</h4><br>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
***
<h4>Titus: 3.4</h4><br>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,
***
<h4>Titus: 3.5</h4><br>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
***
<h4>Titus: 3.6</h4><br>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
***
<h4>Titus: 3.7</h4><br>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
***
<h4>Titus: 3.8</h4><br>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
***
<h4>Titus: 3.9</h4><br>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
***
<h4>Titus: 3.10</h4><br>A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
***
<h4>Titus: 3.11</h4><br>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.
***
<h4>Titus: 3.12</h4><br>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.
***
<h4>Titus: 3.13</h4><br>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
***
<h4>Titus: 3.14</h4><br>And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
***
<h4>Titus: 3.15</h4><br>All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
