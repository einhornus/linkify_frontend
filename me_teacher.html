    I'm a Russian native speaker and I can help you improve your speaking.
    <br>
    I'm not a professional language teacher so I'd only charge <b>$10 for an hour</b> one-to-one class.

<br>
I estimate my English level as C1 so I'm able to do classes in English. You can just speak as much Russian as you can.
<br>
We can be either just speaking in Russian or having a traditional grammar/vocabulary language class. It's entirely up to you.
<br>
<br>
The first <b>trial</b> class is <b>free</b>.
<br>
Get the trial class by contacting me:
